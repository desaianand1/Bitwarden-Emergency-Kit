## Understanding the Threats

### The Two-Threat Model

Most people only prepare for **one** threat to their password security: unauthorized access. However, there are actually **two critical threats** you must defend against:

1. **Unauthorized Access** - Someone else reading your secrets
2. **Lockout** - You losing access to your own vault

**The shocking reality**: If you've properly secured your vault with a strong master password and 2FA, you are statistically **100 times more likely** to lose access due to lockout than unauthorized access.

### Why Lockout Happens More Often

**Human Memory is Unreliable**
- Experimental psychologists have known for 50 years that human memory is not reliable
- You can recall a fact daily for years, then one morning it's simply gone
- Risk of traumatic brain injury, stroke, or death means someone else may need access

**Real User Stories from the Community**
- 2-4 posts per month on Reddit from people locked out of their vaults
- "I have a strong master password and good 2FA, but today I can't log in!"
- Grieving spouses unable to access deceased partner's accounts
- Lost phones destroying TOTP app datastores with no backup

**The "Just Reset Everything" Fallacy**
- Where do you get the list of websites? (It's in your locked vault)
- Many secrets have no recovery workflow (gym locker combinations, device PINs)
- Recovery questions create security risks if answered truthfully
- Some items are irreplaceable (software licenses, WiFi passwords, vehicle information)

### Emergency Kit vs. Backup: Understanding the Difference

**Emergency Kit**: Helps you regain access to your existing, intact vault
- Assumes your Bitwarden data is safe on their servers
- Contains the "keys" to unlock your existing vault
- Physical document stored outside your vault

**Backup**: Protects against data loss or corruption
- Assumes your vault data might be lost, corrupted, or inaccessible
- Contains a complete copy of your vault data
- Can be restored to a new vault or different service

**Both are necessary** for complete protection. This guide covers both in a tiered approach.

## Tier 1: Essential Emergency Kit

### What is an Emergency Kit?

An emergency kit is a physical document containing the essential information needed to regain access to your vault. It's your "break glass in case of emergency" solution.

### Essential Components

**Core Bitwarden Information**:
- Server URL (https://vault.bitwarden.com or https://vault.bitwarden.eu)
- Email address used for your Bitwarden account
- Master password (written clearly and legibly)
- 2FA recovery code from Bitwarden

**Supporting Email Account**:
- Email provider URL
- Email password
- Email 2FA recovery codes

**Authenticator App Recovery** (if using TOTP):
- **For Ente Auth**: Username, password, and recovery key
- **For other apps**: Whatever recovery method they provide

**Device Access Information**:
- Computer login passwords
- Phone PINs
- Hardware security key PINs

### Creating Your Emergency Kit

**Step 1: Use the Emergency Kit Template**
- Use our [Emergency Kit Web App](../emergency-kit-app/) to generate a printable template
- Fill it out by hand with a reliable pen
- Double-check every character for accuracy

**Step 2: Test Before Storing**
- Use the information on your sheet to log into Bitwarden
- Verify you can access your email account
- Confirm all information is correct and legible

**Step 3: Secure Storage**
- Store in a fireproof document bag or safe
- Keep with other important documents (birth certificate, passport, etc.)
- Consider a tamper-evident security envelope

**Step 4: Create Multiple Copies**
- Make at least 2 copies of your emergency kit
- Store one copy offsite (family member, safe deposit box)
- Update all copies whenever information changes

### Where to Store Your Emergency Kit

**Primary Location (Home)**:
- Fireproof safe or document box
- With other important papers
- Known location that family members can find

**Secondary Location (Offsite)**:
- Trusted family member's house
- Safe deposit box at bank
- Sealed envelope with executor of your estate

**Creative Storage Ideas** (from community wisdom):
- Taped to large appliances (washing machine, water heater)
- Inside a book (cookbook, manual you'll never lose)
- False bottom drawer
- With vehicle registration documents

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't store digitally** - No cloud storage, no photos, no digital files
❌ **Don't store in just one location** - Fire, flood, or loss could destroy your only copy
❌ **Don't use pencil** - Can fade or smudge over time
❌ **Don't assume you'll remember** - Your brain is not a reliable backup system
❌ **Don't forget to update** - When you change passwords, update ALL copies

## Tier 2: Basic Digital Backups

### When You Need More Than an Emergency Kit

An emergency kit assumes your vault data is intact on Bitwarden's servers. But what if:
- Bitwarden servers are down or compromised
- Your vault gets corrupted or accidentally deleted
- You need to migrate to a different password manager
- You accidentally delete important entries

This is where backups become essential.

### Bitwarden Export Process

**Step 1: Choose Export Format**
- **JSON (Encrypted, Password-Protected)** - RECOMMENDED
- **JSON (Unencrypted)** - Only if you'll encrypt it yourself
- **CSV** - Limited data, only for migration purposes

**Step 2: Create the Export**
1. Log into Bitwarden Web Vault
2. Go to Tools → Export Vault
3. Select "JSON (Encrypted)" format
4. Choose "Password Protected" option
5. Create a strong 6+ word passphrase for the export
6. Download the encrypted file

**Step 3: Handle Organization/Collection Data**
- Personal vault exports don't include shared Collections
- Export each Organization separately from the Admin Console
- Use the same password-protected JSON format

**Step 4: Document File Attachments**
- Premium users: Choose "Encrypted ZIP" format to include attachments
- Free users: Download attachments manually and document which belong to which entry

### Ente Auth Backup Process

**Step 1: Export Your TOTP Secrets**
1. Open Ente Auth app
2. Go to Settings → Data → Export
3. Choose encrypted export option
4. Save the export file securely

**Step 2: Document Recovery Information**
- Ente Auth username and password
- Recovery key (from initial setup)
- Location of export file

**Step 3: Test the Export**
- Import the export into a test Ente Auth account
- Verify all TOTP codes are working
- Document the import process

### Simple Storage Methods

**USB Drive Storage**:
- Use at least 2 USB drives from different manufacturers
- Store in different physical locations
- Climate-controlled environment (not car glove box)
- Label drives clearly but not obviously

**Basic Encryption** (if not using Bitwarden's built-in encryption):
- 7-Zip with AES-256 encryption
- Strong passphrase (6+ words)
- Store encryption password separately from encrypted files

**Cloud Storage** (Advanced Users Only):
- Only if files are already encrypted
- Use different cloud provider than your email
- Enable 2FA on cloud storage account
- Document cloud access credentials separately

### Backup Schedule and Maintenance

**When to Create New Backups**:
- Monthly for active users
- Quarterly minimum for all users
- Immediately after major changes (new 2FA, password changes)
- Before and after travel

**Backup Validation**:
- Test restore process annually
- Verify file integrity quarterly
- Check that encryption passwords still work
- Ensure backup storage locations are still accessible

### Distributed Storage Strategy

**The Three-Location Rule**:
Never store all copies in one location. Use at least three different locations:

**Location 1: Home**
- Primary backup drive
- Easily accessible for regular updates
- Fireproof safe or secure location

**Location 2: Offsite (Family/Friends)**
- Secondary backup drive
- Trusted family member or friend
- Include basic instructions for access

**Location 3: Professional Storage**
- Safe deposit box at bank
- Professional document storage
- Long-term preservation focus

**Encryption Key Distribution**:
- **Never store the encryption key with the encrypted backup**
- Store encryption key in your emergency sheet
- Consider puzzle-format for family members
- Use Shamir's Secret Sharing for ultimate security (advanced)

### Creating and Maintaining Advanced Backups

**Monthly Backup Process**:
1. Mount your VeraCrypt container
2. Update all export files
3. Update recovery codes document
4. Update emergency sheet if needed
5. Test one random restore procedure
6. Dismount container securely
7. Copy to all backup locations

**Annual Full Validation**:
1. Test complete restore from each backup location
2. Verify all encryption keys work
3. Update VeraCrypt software and installers
4. Review and update storage locations
5. Train family members on access procedures

## Tier 4: Disaster Recovery Planning

### Single Point of Failure (SPOF) Analysis

A Single Point of Failure is any component that, if it fails, brings down your entire security system. Common SPOFs in password management:

**Your Master Password**
- SPOF: Only in your memory
- Solution: Written in emergency sheet, multiple locations

**Your 2FA Device**
- SPOF: Only one phone or hardware key
- Solution: Multiple devices, recovery codes, backup methods

**Your Emergency Sheet**
- SPOF: Only one copy, one location
- Solution: Multiple copies, multiple locations

**Your Backup Encryption Key**
- SPOF: Stored with encrypted backup
- Solution: Separate storage, multiple copies

**Your Death**
- SPOF: Only you know how to access everything
- Solution: Estate planning, family training, clear instructions

### Estate Planning Integration

**Legal Document Updates**:
- Update your will to mention digital assets
- Include emergency sheet locations in estate documents
- Ensure executor knows about backup locations
- Consider digital asset clause in power of attorney

**Family Communication**:
- Inform trusted family members about emergency procedures
- Provide basic training on accessing backups
- Create simple instruction sheets for non-technical users
- Establish regular check-ins to verify access

**Professional Support**:

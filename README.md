# Bitwarden Emergency Kit Project

A comprehensive security backup and recovery system for Bitwarden password manager users, featuring guides, tools, and emergency preparedness resources.

## Project Overview

This project addresses the critical "Two-Threat Model" of password security:

1. **Unauthorized Access** - Someone else reading your secrets
2. **Lockout** - You losing access to your own vault

Most people only prepare for the first threat, but statistically, you're 100x more likely to lose access due to lockout than unauthorized access.

## Deliverables

### 1. Comprehensive Backup & Recovery Guide

**Location**: `guides/comprehensive-backup-guide.md`

A complete guide covering four tiers of backup strategies:

- **Tier 1**: Essential Emergency Kit (physical document)
- **Tier 2**: Basic Digital Backups (encrypted exports)
- **Tier 3**: Advanced Encrypted Backups (VeraCrypt containers)
- **Tier 4**: Disaster Recovery Planning (estate planning, SPOF analysis)

**Features**:

- Real user stories and community wisdom
- Step-by-step instructions with examples
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Testing and maintenance procedures

### 2. Beginner's Security Guide

**Location**: `guides/beginner-security-guide.md`

A complete introduction to password security for newcomers:

- Understanding the security landscape in 2025
- Choosing tools (Bitwarden + Ente Auth focus)
- Initial setup with emergency preparedness
- Daily usage patterns and best practices
- Maintenance and security hygiene
- Emergency scenario handling

**Target Audience**: Users with moderate computer literacy who are new to password managers

### 3. Emergency Kit Web Application

**Location**: `emergency-kit-app/`

A static SvelteKit web application that generates printable emergency kit templates.

**Features**:

- Print-optimized design for A4 and Letter paper
- Comprehensive form with 7 sections:
  1. Bitwarden Account Information
  2. Email Account Backup
  3. Authenticator App Information
  4. Device Access Information
  5. Emergency Contacts
  6. Storage and Maintenance
  7. Additional Notes
- Offline functionality (no data persistence for security)
- Cross-browser print compatibility
- Professional, clean design optimized for handwriting

**Technology Stack**:

- SvelteKit with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide Svelte for icons
- Static site generation for offline use

## Key Insights from Research

### The Two-Threat Model Discovery

Based on extensive community research, we identified that most security advice only addresses unauthorized access, ignoring the more common threat of lockout.

### Community Wisdom Captured

- Real user stories of lockouts and recovery failures
- Expert recommendations from experienced users
- Common failure modes and prevention strategies
- Evolution of best practices over time

### Critical Patterns Identified

- **SPOF Elimination**: Every critical component needs redundancy
- **Physical Storage**: Digital-only solutions create circular dependencies
- **Family Planning**: Emergency access must work for non-technical users
- **Regular Testing**: Untested backups are not backups

## Usage Instructions

### For the Guides

1. Start with the **Beginner's Security Guide** if you're new to password managers
2. Progress to the **Comprehensive Backup Guide** for advanced protection
3. Both guides cross-reference each other and the emergency kit app

### For the Emergency Kit App

1. Navigate to `emergency-kit-app/`
2. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `pnpm run dev` to start development server
4. Visit <http://localhost:5173> to access the emergency kit form
5. Print the form and fill it out by hand
6. Store securely in multiple locations

### For Static Deployment

1. Run `pnpm run build` in the `emergency-kit-app/` directory
2. The `build/` folder contains the static site
3. Deploy to any static hosting service or use locally

## Security Principles

### Data Handling

- **No Data Persistence**: The web app never stores any information
- **Print Security**: Designed for offline, handwritten completion
- **No Analytics**: No tracking or external API calls
- **Offline Capable**: Works without internet connection

### Best Practices Implemented

- Multiple backup locations required
- Physical and digital redundancy
- Family-friendly instructions
- Regular testing procedures
- Estate planning integration

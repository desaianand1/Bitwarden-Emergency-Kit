## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

**Risk**: Documentation becomes too complex for target audience
**Mitigation**: Regular user feedback, tiered approach, clear examples

**Risk**: Emergency kit form doesn't print correctly across browsers
**Mitigation**: Extensive print testing, CSS fallbacks, multiple formats

**Risk**: Guides become outdated as tools evolve
**Mitigation**: Version control, update schedule, focus on principles

### Medium-Risk Items

**Risk**: SvelteKit app becomes too feature-heavy
**Mitigation**: Stick to core requirements, avoid feature creep

**Risk**: Guides are too long and overwhelming
**Mitigation**: Clear structure, executive summaries, quick-start sections

## Dependencies and Blockers

### External Dependencies

**None Currently Identified**:

- All required information available in memory bank
- No external approvals needed
- All tools and frameworks are open source

### Potential Blockers

**User Feedback Delays**:

- Mitigation: Proceed with implementation, incorporate feedback iteratively

**Technical Issues with Print CSS**:

- Mitigation: Research print CSS best practices, test early and often

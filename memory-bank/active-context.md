### Key Insights Extracted

**The Two-Threat Model Discovery**:

- Most critical insight: There are TWO threats to password security, not one
- Threat 1: Unauthorized access (what everyone prepares for)
- Threat 2: Lockout (what most people ignore, but statistically more likely)
- This becomes the foundation of all our guides

**Emergency Kit vs. Backup Distinction**:

- Emergency Kit: Regain access to existing, intact vault
- Backup: Protect against data loss/corruption
- Both are necessary for complete protection

**Community Wisdom Captured**:

- Real user stories of lockouts and recovery failures
- Expert recommendations from experienced users
- Common failure modes and how to prevent them
- Best practices that have evolved over time

### Planning Discussion Results

**User Requirements Clarified**:

- Printable emergency kit template (hand-filled, not digital)
- Tiered approach (simple to advanced)
- Bitwarden + Ente Auth focus with alternatives mentioned
- Moderate technical level for beginner guide
- SvelteKit app with specific tech stack requirements

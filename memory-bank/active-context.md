# Active Context: Current Work Focus

## Current Phase: Memory Bank Creation

**Status**: In Progress - Creating comprehensive memory bank to preserve all context from documentation research and planning discussion.

**Immediate Goal**: Document all critical insights from the 12 source files and planning conversation to ensure no knowledge is lost when implementation begins.

## Recent Accomplishments

### Documentation Analysis Completed

**Source Files Analyzed** (12 total):

- `10+ Places To Hide Your Master Password - Password Bits.txt`
- `bitwarden-forum-emergency-kit-discussion.txt`
- `bitwarden-github-backups.md`
- `bitwarden-github-cannot-login.md`
- `bitwarden-github-emergency-kit.md`
- `bitwarden-github-getting-started.md`
- `bitwarden-github-spof.md`
- `bitwarden-github-what-to-store.md`
- `bitwarden-reddit-post-1.txt`
- `bitwarden-reddit-post-2.txt`
- `bitwarden-reddit-post-3.txt`
- `Password Manager Emergency Sheet - Password Bits.txt`

### Key Insights Extracted

**The Two-Threat Model Discovery**:

- Most critical insight: There are TWO threats to password security, not one
- Threat 1: Unauthorized access (what everyone prepares for)
- Threat 2: Lockout (what most people ignore, but statistically more likely)
- This becomes the foundation of all our guides

**Emergency Kit vs. Backup Distinction**:

- Emergency Kit: Regain access to existing, intact vault
- Backup: Protect against data loss/corruption
- Both are necessary for complete protection

**Community Wisdom Captured**:

- Real user stories of lockouts and recovery failures
- Expert recommendations from experienced users
- Common failure modes and how to prevent them
- Best practices that have evolved over time

### Planning Discussion Results

**User Requirements Clarified**:

- Printable emergency kit template (hand-filled, not digital)
- Tiered approach (simple to advanced)
- Bitwarden + Ente Auth focus with alternatives mentioned
- Moderate technical level for beginner guide
- SvelteKit app with specific tech stack requirements

## Current Work Items

### Memory Bank Files Status

**Completed**:

- ‚úÖ `project-brief.md` - Core requirements and deliverables
- ‚úÖ `product-context.md` - Why this project matters and user problems
- ‚úÖ `system-patterns.md` - Architecture and security patterns
- ‚úÖ `tech-context.md` - Technical implementation details

**In Progress**:

- üîÑ `active-context.md` - This file, current work focus
- ‚è≥ `progress.md` - What's built and what remains

### Next Immediate Steps

1. **Complete Memory Bank** (Current)
   - Finish `active-context.md`
   - Create `progress.md` with implementation roadmap
   - Validate all context is preserved

2. **Begin Implementation** (Next)
   - Start with comprehensive backup guide
   - Create SvelteKit emergency kit app
   - Develop beginner security guide

## Key Decisions Made

### Technical Architecture

**SvelteKit App Specifications**:

- Static site generation for offline use
- Print-optimized design with Tailwind CSS
- Lucide Svelte for icons
- No data persistence (security requirement)
- Comprehensive form with instructions

**Documentation Format**:

- Markdown for all guides
- Tiered structure (simple ‚Üí advanced)
- Real-world focus with practical examples
- Cross-referenced between guides

### Content Strategy

**Comprehensive Backup Guide Structure**:

1. **Tier 1**: Essential Emergency Kit
2. **Tier 2**: Basic Digital Backups
3. **Tier 3**: Advanced Encrypted Backups (VeraCrypt)
4. **Tier 4**: Comprehensive Disaster Recovery

**Beginner Guide Approach**:

- Assumes moderate computer literacy
- Focuses on Bitwarden + Ente Auth
- Mentions alternatives without overwhelming
- Practical, step-by-step instructions

## Critical Context to Preserve

### From Documentation Research

**Master Password Storage Insights**:

- 10+ creative hiding places for physical storage
- Multiple locations essential (fire/disaster protection)
- Physical beats digital for emergency access
- Family members need clear instructions

**Community Emergency Kit Evolution**:

- Started with simple sheets, evolved to comprehensive forms
- Users want complete information, not minimal versions
- Two-page formats acceptable if comprehensive
- Instructions must be clear for non-technical family

**Backup Strategy Lessons**:

- VeraCrypt preferred for advanced users
- USB drives practical despite limitations
- Encryption keys must be stored separately
- Regular testing of restore procedures critical

**Real User Problems**:

- Autocorrect corrupting master passwords
- KDF settings causing client issues
- New device verification creating circular lockouts
- File attachments requiring special handling

### From Expert Guides

**SPOF Analysis Framework**:

- Every critical component needs redundancy
- Master password, 2FA, emergency sheet, backups
- Death as ultimate SPOF requiring estate planning
- Circular dependencies must be eliminated

**What to Store Where**:

- Emergency sheet: Physical, multiple locations
- Vault: Encrypted cloud storage
- Backups: Encrypted offline archives
- Never store together: Sheet + encryption key

## Risks and Mitigation

### Information Loss Risk

**Risk**: Losing critical insights from extensive documentation
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive memory bank with cross-references

### Implementation Complexity Risk

**Risk**: Overwhelming users with too much information
**Mitigation**: Tiered approach, start simple, build complexity

### Technical Obsolescence Risk

**Risk**: Recommended tools becoming unavailable
**Mitigation**: Include alternatives, focus on principles over tools

## Success Metrics for Current Phase

**Memory Bank Completeness**:

- All 12 source documents insights captured
- Planning discussion decisions documented
- Technical specifications detailed
- Implementation roadmap clear

**Knowledge Preservation**:

- No critical insights lost
- Context easily accessible for implementation
- Cross-references between concepts maintained
- Real user stories and examples preserved

## Next Phase Preparation

## Notes and Observations

### Documentation Quality Insights

**High-Quality Sources**:

- djasonpenney's GitHub guides (comprehensive, expert-level)
- Community forum discussions (real user needs)
- PasswordBits articles (practical, accessible)

**Common Themes Across Sources**:

- Human memory unreliability
- Physical storage necessity
- Multiple location redundancy
- Family/estate planning integration

### User Behavior Patterns

**What Users Actually Do**:

- Forget master passwords despite daily use
- Lose phones with TOTP apps
- Store everything in one location
- Don't prepare for death/incapacitation

**What Users Need**:

- Simple, clear instructions
- Multiple backup strategies
- Family-friendly documentation
- Regular maintenance reminders

This active context captures the current state of work and ensures smooth transition to implementation phase.

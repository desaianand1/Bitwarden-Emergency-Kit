# Product Context: Why This Project Matters

## The Core Problem

Most people only prepare for ONE threat to their password security: unauthorized access. However, there are actually **TWO critical threats**:

1. **Unauthorized Access** - Someone else reading your secrets
2. **Lockout** - You losing access to your own vault

The second threat is statistically much more likely for well-secured users, yet most people are completely unprepared for it.

## The Human Memory Problem

- Experimental psychologists have known for 50 years that human memory is unreliable
- You can recall a fact daily for years, then one morning it's gone
- Risk of traumatic brain injury, stroke, or death means someone else may need access
- "I'll just memorize my master password" is not a viable strategy

## Real-World Impact Stories

From the documentation research:

- 2-4 posts per month on Reddit from people locked out of their vaults
- People looking for "super duper sneaky back doors" (which don't exist)
- Grieving spouses unable to access deceased partner's accounts
- Lost phones destroying TOTP app datastores
- Forgotten master passwords with no recovery options

## What People Get Wrong

### The "Just Reset Everything" Fallacy

- Where do you get the list of websites? (It's in your locked vault)
- Many secrets have no recovery workflow (gym locker combinations, device PINs)
- Recovery questions create security risks if answered truthfully
- Some items are irreplaceable (software licenses, WiFi passwords, etc.)

### Circular Dependencies

- Storing emergency info in the cloud requires cloud credentials
- Those credentials can't be in your locked vault
- Creates infinite loops in recovery scenarios

## The Solution Framework

### Emergency Kit vs. Backup

- **Emergency Kit**: Regain access to existing, intact vault
- **Backup**: Protect against data loss/corruption
- Both are necessary for complete protection

### Tiered Security Approach

1. **Essential Emergency Kit** - Minimum viable recovery
2. **Basic Backups** - Simple export strategies  
3. **Advanced Encrypted Backups** - Comprehensive protection
4. **Disaster Recovery Planning** - Estate planning and SPOF analysis

## User Experience Goals

- Make security accessible to ordinary people
- Provide clear, actionable steps
- Avoid overwhelming beginners while serving advanced users
- Focus on practical, real-world scenarios
- Eliminate single points of failure (SPOF)

## Target User Scenarios

### The Overwhelmed Beginner

- New to password managers
- Intimidated by security concepts
- Needs simple, clear guidance
- Wants to "do it right" from the start

### The Experienced User

- Already using Bitwarden
- Wants comprehensive backup strategy
- Understands technical concepts
- Needs advanced protection methods

### The Emergency Situation

- Vault is locked or inaccessible
- Phone is lost/broken
- Family member has died
- Need immediate access to critical accounts

## Success Metrics

- Users can recover from common lockout scenarios
- Emergency kits are properly filled out and stored
- Backups are created and tested regularly
- Family members know how to access accounts in emergencies
- No single points of failure in security setup

## Key Insights from Documentation

### From Community Discussions

- People want comprehensive emergency kits, not minimal ones
- Multiple storage locations are essential
- Physical copies are preferred over digital
- Instructions must be clear for non-technical family members

### From Expert Guides

- VeraCrypt is preferred for advanced backups
- USB drives are practical for offline storage
- Encryption keys must be stored separately from encrypted data
- Regular testing of recovery procedures is critical

### From Real User Problems

- KDF settings can cause client compatibility issues
- Autocorrect can corrupt master passwords
- New device verification creates circular lockout problems
- File attachments require special handling in backups
